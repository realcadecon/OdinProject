        <h1 class="main-head">How to make THE Chili that will keep you warm in the next Ice Age</h1>
        <h3>
            In the unlikely event, described by Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary", that humanity must endure a mass
            extinction
            event taking the form of a new Ice Age,
            we intend to bring you THE chili recipe to keep you and your loved ones warm. Here's a good place for a
            disclaimer: this chili will infact help you survive
            global temperatures dipping as low -2 celsius and you can personally hold big oil and gas companies liable
            if
            that's not the case.
